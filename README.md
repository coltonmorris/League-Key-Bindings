# League-Key-Bindings
My League of Legends key binding file

In my professional, unlicensed opinion, my keybindings for LoL are world class. 
## Overview
QWER smart casted.
Shift+QWER to aim an ability.
CTRL+QWER to level up an ability.
0 and 9 bound to the mouse wheel scroll forward and back for easy ward hopping and potion chugging.
T for trinket
SHIFT+1234509T to aim an item, ward, or anything in your inventory. I love this when trying to place a ward perfectly in a bush.
X to open the shop
Mouse Button to target champions only. This makes a huge difference in your play, leaves little room for error.
A is the smart cast attack move.
F for flash. duh.
