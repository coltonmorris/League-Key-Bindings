# League-Key-Bindings
My League of Legends key binding file

In my professional, unlicensed opinion, my keybindings for LoL are world class. 
## Overview
<ul>
<li>QWER smart casted. </br>
<li>Shift+QWER to aim an ability.</br>
<li>CTRL+QWER to level up an ability.</br>
<li>0 and 9 bound to the mouse wheel scroll forward and back for easy ward hopping and potion chugging.</br>
<li>T for trinket</br>
<li>SHIFT+1234509T to aim an item, ward, or anything in your inventory. I love this when trying to place a ward perfectly in a bush.</br>
<li>X to open the shop</br>
<li>Mouse Button to target champions only. This makes a huge difference in your play, leaves little room for error.</br>
<li>A is the smart cast attack move.</br>
<li>F for flash. duh.</br>
</ul>
